# PerfumeInsightLab

Perfume analytics project, from raw data to scent-based insights.  
**EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis) on perfume datasets to uncover patterns, trends and insights.

---

## Overview  
**PerfumeInsightLab** aims to :
- Clean and structure raw perfume datasets  
- Explore key features and relationships (brands, accords, notes, ratings, years…)  
- Visualize trends and distributions  
- Generate insights on fragrance characteristics, composition, popularity, market trends 
- Prepare the data for SQL analysis and potential machine learning extensions  

## Tech Stack  
- **Python 3**  
- **Pandas / NumPy** (data cleaning & manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly** (visualizations)  
- **WordCloud** (text-based visualization of notes)  
- **SQL**/**SSMS** (queries and data exploration in databases)  

## Structure
├─ 📁 data/       → Raw perfume datasets, processed (cleaned) data, optional external sources (complementary data for enrichment)    
├─ 📁 notebooks/  → Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, cleaning, visualization and insights generation  
├─ 📁 scripts/    → Python scripts for reusable EDA functions, preprocessing and chart generation  
├─ 📁 reports/    → Visual outputs, summary notes, figures generated from the analysis  
└─ README.md      → Project overview, structure, documentation

## Next Steps  
- Load and explore the dataset structure  
- Perform data cleaning and descriptive statistics  
- Create visualizations and correlations between key attributes  
- Build SQL tables for queries and relational analysis  
- Add interactive dashboards or machine learning experiments
